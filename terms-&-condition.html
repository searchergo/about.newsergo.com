              <p>Posted: March 25, 2019<br>Effective: March 26, 2019</p>
              <p>Thanks for using Nicksta! These terms of service (“Terms”) cover your use and access to our services,
                client software and websites ("Services").
                If you reside outside of the United States of America, Canada and Mexico (“North America”) your
                agreement is with Nicksta International Unlimited
                Company, and if you reside in North America your agreement is with Nicksta, Inc. Our Privacy Policy
                explains how we collect and use your
                information while our Acceptable Use Policy outlines your responsibilities when using our Services. By
                using our Services, you’re agreeing to be
                bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy. If you’re using our Services for an
                organization, you’re agreeing to these
                Terms on behalf of that organization.</p>

              <h3>Your Stuff & Your Permissions</h3>
              <p>When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, messages, contacts, and
                so on (“Your Stuff”). Your Stuff is yours. These
                Terms don’t give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the
                Services.</p>
              <p>We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up, and sharing it when you
                ask us to. Our Services also provide you with
                features like photo thumbnails, document previews, commenting, easy sorting, editing, sharing, and
                searching. These and other features may require
                our systems to access, store, and scan Your Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this
                permission extends to our affiliates and
                trusted third parties we work with.</p>

              <h3>Sharing Your Stuff</h3>
              <p>Our Services let you share Your Stuff with others, so please think carefully about what you share.</p>

              <h3>Your Responsibilities</h3>
              <p>You’re responsible for your conduct. Your Stuff and you must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy.
                Content in the Services may be protected by
                others’ intellectual property rights. Please don’t copy, upload, download, or share content unless you
                have the right to do so.</p>
              <p>We may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our Acceptable Use Policy.
                With that said, we have no obligation to
                do so. We aren’t responsible for the content people post and share via the Services.</p>
              <p>Help us keep you informed and Your Stuff protected. Safeguard your password to the Services, and keep
                your account information current. Don’t
                share your account credentials or give others access to your account.
              </p>
              <p>You may use our Services only as permitted by applicable law, including export control laws and
                regulations. Finally, to use our Services, you must
                be at least 13, or in some cases, even older. If you live in France, Germany, or the Netherlands, you
                must be at least 16. Please check your local law
                for the age of digital consent. If you don’t meet these age requirements, you may not use the Services.
              </p>
              <h3>Software</h3>
              <p>Some of our Services allow you to download client software (“Software”) which may update automatically.
                So long as you comply with these Terms,
                we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to
                access the Services. To the extent any
                component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, we’ll make that license available
                to you and the provisions of that license
                may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you
                agree not to reverse engineer or
                decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.</p>
              <h3>Termination</h3>
              <p>You’re free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your
                access to the Services with notice to you if:</p>
              <p>(a) You’re in breach of these Terms,</p>
              <p>(b) Your use of the Services in a manner that would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or other
                users, or</p>
              <p>(c) You don’t have a Paid Account and haven't accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months.</p>
              <p>We’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your account to
                remedy the activity that prompted us to
                contact you and give you the opportunity to export Your Stuff from our Services. If after such notice
                you fail to take the steps we ask of you,
                we’ll terminate or suspend your access to the Services.</p>
              <p>We won’t provide notice before termination where:</p>
              <p>(a) You’re in material breach of these Terms,</p>
              <p>(b) Doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our
                other users, or</p>
              <p>(c) We're prohibited from doing so by law.</p>
              <h3>Discontinuation of Services</h3>
              <p>We may decide to discontinue the Services in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond Nicksta’s
                control or to comply with a legal requirement.
                If we do so, we’ll give you reasonable prior notice so that you can export Your Stuff from our systems.
                If we discontinue Services in this way before
                the end of any fixed or minimum term you have paid us for, we’ll refund the portion of the fees you have
                pre-paid but haven't received Services for.</p>

              <h3>Services “AS IS”</h3>
              <p>We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee. TO THE

                so on (“Your Stuff”). Your Stuff is yours. These
                Terms don’t give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the

              <p>We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up, and sharing it when you
                ask us to. Our Services also provide you with
                features like photo thumbnails, document previews, commenting, easy sorting, editing, sharing, and
                searching. These and other features may require
                our systems to access, store, and scan Your Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this
                permission extends to our affiliates and
                trusted third parties we work with.</p>

              <h3>Sharing Your Stuff</h3>
              <p>Our Services let you share Your Stuff with others, so please think carefully about what you share.</p>

                Content in the Services may be protected by

                we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to
                access the Services. To the extent any

                may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you

              <p>(b) Your use of the Services in a manner that would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or other

              <p>We’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your account to
                remedy the activity that prompted us to
                contact you and give you the opportunity to export Your Stuff from our Services. If after such notice
                you fail to take the steps we ask of you,
                we’ll terminate or suspend your access to the Services.</p>

              <p>(a) You’re in material breach of these Terms,</p>
              <p>(b) Doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our
                other users, or</p>
              <p>(c) We're prohibited from doing so by law.</p>

                If we do so, we’ll give you reasonable prior notice so that you can export Your Stuff from our systems.
                If we discontinue Services in this way before
                the end of any fixed or minimum term you have paid us for, we’ll refund the portion of the fees you have
                pre-paid but haven't received Services for.</p>

              <p>Thanks for using Nicksta! These terms of service (“Terms”) cover your use and access to our services,
                client software and websites ("Services").
                If you reside outside of the United States of America, Canada and Mexico (“North America”) your
                agreement is with Nicksta International Unlimited
                Company, and if you reside in North America your agreement is with Nicksta, Inc. Our Privacy Policy
                explains how we collect and use your
                information while our Acceptable Use Policy outlines your responsibilities when using our Services. By
                using our Services, you’re agreeing to be
                bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy. If you’re using our Services for an

                Terms on behalf of that organization.</p>

              <h3>Your Stuff & Your Permissions</h3>
              <p>When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, messages, contacts, and
                so on (“Your Stuff”). Your Stuff is yours. These
                Terms don’t give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the
                Services.</p>
              <p>We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up, and sharing it when you
                ask us to. Our Services also provide you with
                features like photo thumbnails, document previews, commenting, easy sorting, editing, sharing, and
                searching. These and other features may require
                our systems to access, store, and scan Your Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this
                permission extends to our affiliates and
                trusted third parties we work with.</p>

              <h3>Sharing Your Stuff</h3>
              <p>Our Services let you share Your Stuff with others, so please think carefully about what you share.</p>

              <h3>Your Responsibilities</h3>
              <p>You’re responsible for your conduct. Your Stuff and you must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy.
                Content in the Services may be protected by
                others’ intellectual property rights. Please don’t copy, upload, download, or share content unless you
                have the right to do so.</p>
              <p>We may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our Acceptable Use Policy.
                With that said, we have no obligation to
                do so. We aren’t responsible for the content people post and share via the Services.</p>
              <p>Help us keep you informed and Your Stuff protected. Safeguard your password to the Services, and keep
                your account information current. Don’t
                share your account credentials or give others access to your account.
              </p>
